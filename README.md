# ✈️ Airline Authority Analysis – A Power BI Dashboard  

### 🛫 Why do flights get delayed? Let’s uncover the truth!  

Have you ever rushed to the airport, only to see your flight **delayed** or even **canceled**? It’s frustrating, right? I wanted to dig deeper and find out **why this happens**, which airlines perform best, and when delays are most common.  

That's how this **Power BI project** was born. 🚀

## 📊 What This Project Covers  

✅ **Which airlines have the most delays?**  
✅ **Which days and months are worst for delays?**  
✅ **How do cancellations impact the airline industry?**  
✅ **What patterns can we spot to improve airline scheduling?**  

Using **Power BI - Data Visualization**, I analyzed real flight data to uncover insights that could help both passengers and airline companies.

## 🔍 Key Insights  

📌 **Monday & Thursday = More delays!** 🕐  
Business travelers take flights on these days, leading to congestion and more delays.  

📌 **December & July are the worst months** for on-time performance! ❄️☀️  
Holidays, weather conditions, and increased passenger volume cause major disruptions.  

📌 **Some airlines cancel flights more than others!** 🚨  
By analyzing trends, we can predict and reduce unnecessary cancellations.  

📌 **Delays impact costs & customer experience.** 💸  
Better scheduling and predictive analytics can improve airline operations.

## 💡 Lessons Learned  

1️⃣ **Data can tell powerful stories.** Numbers alone don’t mean much, but when visualized, they reveal hidden insights!  
2️⃣ **Choosing the right visualizations matters.** A simple **bar chart** can sometimes be more powerful than complex visuals.  
3️⃣ **Real-world data is messy!** Cleaning and transforming data is a crucial step in any analysis.
